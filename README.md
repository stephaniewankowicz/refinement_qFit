This repository contains the scripts to run refinement on a large group of PDB files, run qFit, and run post qFit refinement.

Due to the large number of PDB files, there are A LOT of issues with refinement. The majority of them should be caught with the original script, however, additional scripts are provided that may solve the special problem you run into.
